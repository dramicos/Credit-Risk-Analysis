# Overview:
This is a quick study to see which supervised machine learning model performs best at predicting whether or not a person get approved for a loan based on available data.  In this study I will compare logistic regression to a random forests classifier. 

## Models used
Logistic Regression:  As a model that exists outside of machine learning it already gives as a result the probability of an event occuring.  As such it should be well equipped to get a very good result even without the learning element.

Random Forest Classifier:  As a form of decision tree, it can be robust due to being invariant under scaling and other transforms of feature data as well as having tolerance for inclusion of features with no impact.  It performs better though since the randomness and averaging of multiple trees will help prevent overfitting.
